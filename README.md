## How to use MAP-D

#### Docker

Do we need to explain scispacy installation etc. if Docker is already containerizing everything

#### scispacy Installation
Installing scispacy requires two steps: installing the library and intalling the models. To install the library, run:
```bash
pip install scispacy
```

to install a model (see our full selection of available models below), run a command like the following:

```bash
pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.1/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.1.tar.gz
```

Note: We strongly recommend that you use an isolated Python environment (such as virtualenv or conda) to install scispacy.
Take a look below in the "Setting up a virtual environment" section if you need some help with this.
Additionally, scispacy uses modern features of Python and as such is only available for **Python 3.6 or greater**.


#### Setting up a virtual environment

[Conda](https://conda.io/) can be used set up a virtual environment with the
version of Python required for scispaCy.  If you already have a Python
environment you want to use, you can skip to the 'installing via pip' section.

1.  [Follow the installation instructions for Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html?highlight=conda#regular-installation).

2.  Create a Conda environment called "scispacy" with Python 3.9 (any version >= 3.6 should work):

    ```bash
    conda create -n scispacy python=3.9
    ```

3.  Activate the Conda environment. You will need to activate the Conda environment in each terminal in which you want to use scispaCy.

    ```bash
    source activate scispacy
    ```

Now you can install `scispacy` and one of the models using the steps above.


Once you have completed the above steps and downloaded one of the models below, you can load a scispaCy model as you would any other spaCy model. For example:
```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_sci_sm")
doc = nlp("Alterations in the hypocretin receptor 2 and preprohypocretin genes produce narcolepsy in some animals.")
```

#### Note on upgrading
If you are upgrading `scispacy`, you will need to download the models again, to get the model versions compatible with the version of `scispacy` that you have. The link to the model that you download should contain the version number of `scispacy` that you have.

## Available Models

To install a model, click on the link below to download the model, and then run 

```python
pip install </path/to/download>
```

Alternatively, you can install directly from the URL by right-clicking on the link, selecting "Copy Link Address" and running 
```python
pip install CMD-V(to paste the copied URL)
```

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

    abstract = "Despite recent advances in natural language processing, many statistical models for processing text perform extremely poorly under domain shift. Processing biomedical and clinical text is a critically important application area of natural language processing, for which there are few robust, practical, publicly available models. This paper describes scispaCy, a new Python library and models for practical biomedical/scientific text processing, which heavily leverages the spaCy library. We detail the performance of two packages of models released in scispaCy and demonstrate their robustness on several tasks and datasets. Models and code are available at https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/.",
