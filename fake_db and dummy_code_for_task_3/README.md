Hi,

This folder contains:

1. MyDB.db - dummy database with 5-6 records for testing purposes.

3. dummy.py - contains the function I defined for task 3. 

I used this function to test GUI display.

The function retrieves DB rows (PMID, date of publication) with abstract texts that contain the keyword passed to this function. It also has a line of code that wraps the keyword into a #<mark># HTML tag for highlighting the keywords in the abstract on the webpage.
