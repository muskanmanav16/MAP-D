31352337,Constrained Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging by Learning Nonlinear Low-Dimensional Models.,29-07-2019,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a powerful molecular imaging modality but has very limited speed, resolution, and SNR tradeoffs. Construction of a low-dimensional model to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem has recently shown great promise in improving these tradeoffs. This paper presents a new approach to model and reconstruct the spectroscopic signals by learning a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the general MR spectra. Specifically, we trained a deep neural network to capture the low-dimensional manifold, where the high-dimensional spectroscopic signals reside. A regularization formulation is proposed to effectively integrate the learned model and physics-based data acquisition model for MRSI reconstruction with the capability to incorporate additional spatiospectral constraints. An efficient numerical algorithm was developed to solve the associated optimization problem involving back-propagating the trained network. Simulation and experimental results were obtained to demonstrate the representation power of the learned model and the ability of the proposed formulation in producing SNR-enhancing reconstruction from the practical MRSI data.'], 'Constrained Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging by Learning Nonlinear Low-Dimensional Models.'","Algorithms,Computer Simulation,Humans,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Machine Learning,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Neural Networks, Computer,Nonlinear Dynamics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31352337

25420254,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,25-11-2014,"For decades, it has been largely unknown to what extent multiple functional networks spatially overlap/interact with each other and jointly realize the total cortical function. Here, by developing novel sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI signals and by using the recently publicly released large-scale Human Connectome Project high-quality fMRI data, we show that a number of reproducible and robust functional networks, including both task-evoked and resting state networks, are simultaneously distributed in distant neuroanatomic areas and substantially spatially overlapping with each other, thus forming an initial collection of holistic atlases of functional networks and interactions (HAFNIs). More interestingly, the HAFNIs revealed two distinct patterns of highly overlapped regions and highly specialized regions and exhibited that these two patterns of areas are reciprocally localized, revealing a novel organizational principle of cortical function.'], 'Holistic atlases of functional networks and interactions reveal reciprocal organizational architecture of cortical function.'","Adult,Brain Mapping,Cerebral Cortex,Databases, Factual,Female,Humans,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25420254

27669264,A Wireless 32-Channel Implantable Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface.,20-07-2016,"All neural information systems (NIS) rely on sensing neural activity to supply commands and control signals for computers, machines and a variety of prosthetic devices. Invasive systems achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by eliminating the volume conduction problems caused by tissue and bone. An implantable brain machine interface (BMI) using intracortical electrodes provides excellent detection of a broad range of frequency oscillatory activities through the placement of a sensor in direct contact with cortex. This paper introduces a compact-sized implantable wireless 32-channel bidirectional brain machine interface (BBMI) to be used with freely-moving primates. The system is designed to monitor brain sensorimotor rhythms and present current stimuli with a configurable duration, frequency and amplitude in real time to the brain based on the brain activity report. The battery is charged via a novel ultrasonic wireless power delivery module developed for efficient delivery of power into a deeply-implanted system. The system was successfully tested through bench tests and in vivo tests on a behaving primate to record the local field potential (LFP) oscillation and stimulate the target area at the same time.'], 'A Wireless 32-Channel Implantable Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface.'","Biosensing Techniques,Brain-Computer Interfaces,Humans,Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted,Signal-To-Noise Ratio,Wireless Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27669264
